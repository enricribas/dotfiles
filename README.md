** VIM for RAILS

* What are you talking about?

I used to use TextMate, which was great, but then I moved to Sublime which was
awesome, and then I heard about VIM. At first, I thought anyone using VIM was
crazy, but after reading more and more about it, I think if you're programming long enough, you'll eventually switch
to VIM (or eMacs)

Unfortunately, setting up VIM for Rails is a pain in the a$$S!

So I created this, so anyone new could quickly get up and running with VIM

Disclaimer: I've done very little work except for setting up this repo. I did not create any of the wonderful plugins, VAM, or anything else related. I simply did a lot of research to find all the best plugins. 

* How?

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `ruby activate.rb`

Be warned: this will overwrite any existing .vimrc, .gvimrc or .vim/ files you
have in your home directory.

3. Install dependencies, like git and hg for VAM (vim-addons-manager)
4. run `vim`

VAM will download and setup .vim for all addons. You may have to try multiple
times for it to work properly. If you get stuck, press arrow-up. Weird. I
don't know why.

Good luck, and remember this is a work in progress since I am new to VIM.

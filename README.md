# dotfiles

> **Be warned:** this will overwrite any existing `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` etc files you have in your home directory. Backup your dotfiles and then move them into your cloned repository without the leading `.` so you can save them to github before running this command!

### How?

1. Run
```
ruby activate.rb
```
